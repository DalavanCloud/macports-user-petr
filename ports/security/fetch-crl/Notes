# The standard UI message

###########################################################
# A startup item has been generated that will aid in
# starting fetch-crl with launchd. It is disabled
# by default. Execute the following command to start it,
# and to cause it to launch at startup:
#
# sudo port load fetch-crl
###########################################################

# This seems to "unload" the item by it label
# system "launchctl remove org.eugridpma.fetch-crl || true"



#More interesting plist keys:

 RunAtLoad <boolean>
     This optional key is used to control whether your job is launched once at the time the job is loaded.
     The default is false.

WatchPaths <array of strings>
     This optional key causes the job to be started if any one of the listed paths are modified.

QueueDirectories <array of strings>
     Much like the WatchPaths option, this key will watch the paths for modifications. The difference being
     that the job will only be started if the path is a directory and the directory is not empty.
